# NemoTrainer

Thank you for your interest in NemoTrainer!
Please feel free to reach out to kanwalj@georgetown.edu with any questions.

There are two ways to run NemoTrainer:
1. Using JAVA (which enables the use of a graphical user interface (GUI))
2. Using an Arduino script

Method 1 (using JAVA):
Download Ardulink (from this GitHub)
Upload the Ardulink script to the Arduino. It's called Ardulink4Zebrafish.ino.
Launch the zebrafish.bat file. This will launch the GUI.
Configure the parameters of your experiment and run it.

Method 2 (using an Arduino script):
For Operant Conditioning, upload the Operant2SoloLED.ino file to the Arduino. Immediately launch gobetwino.exe.
For Classical Conditioning, upload the TimeGoIfLED6.ino file to the Arduino. Immediately launch gobetwino.exe.

Before GoBetwino can be used successfully, it will need to be configured to launch the correct programs and/or send the correct keystrokes.
To do this, please refer to GoBetwinoManual.pdf, which is accessible from within the GoBetwino folder.
